How can we solve climate change?
We can do this with help of regreening! Recent studies show that nature-based solutions can contribute up to 37% of the carbon emission intake required to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. Vegetation cause the sequestration of carbon, decreasing the amount carbon in the atmosphere and subsequently reducing the greenhouse effect, ultimately leading to the mitigation of global warming. Vegetation also causes cooling of the soil, decreasing the evaporation of water from the soil leading to increased water availability for plants, animals and humans. In addition, greening stimulates the water cycle, causing increased rainfall and the retention of water in the soil. This increasement of the soil moisture content makes the land available for agriculture again, producing food and income for the local communities.
